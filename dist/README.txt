To start the application, simple execute `main.exe`
This should generate the folders nessesary.

When the application is open, clicking `Load all CSV files` will load all the files in the data folder with the corresponding settings file.

You can now view and edit the settings for all the files.

Clicking `Execute reduction algorithms` will run through all the reduction and classification iterations.
Aftet this has completed, it will generate graphs under the visualisation Tab.

If you edit the settings for a csv file, make sure to save them.

Currently the application might run slow in some places, there also may be some random crashes.
Its an early version and i already have a list of things to add.

More varients of graphs
Reduction and classificaion settings
Enabling, disabling and adding of new algorithms
