Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below.
The following considerations are for informational purposes only,
are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.


*
  **Considerations for licensors:** Our public licenses are intended
  for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use
  material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other
  rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand
  the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
  Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our
  licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.
  Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.
  This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
  exception or limitation to copyright. `More considerations for
  licensors <http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors>`_.

*
  **Considerations for the public:** By using one of our public licenses,
  a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
  specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not
  necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception
  or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license.
  Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other
  rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed
  material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because
  others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may
  make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
  described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged
  to respect those requests where reasonable. `More considerations for
  the public <http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees>`_.
